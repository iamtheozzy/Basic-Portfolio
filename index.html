          <p>I'm a 27 year old Chicagoan with a passion for the arts and people. I grew up in Humbolt Park or the northwest side of Chicago. It has everything you would want, from the best Puerto Rican food you could ever dream of, to a man who rides his bike around Humbold Park in a "Puerto Rican Man" costume I spend most of my time taking photographs of the city and capturing portraits of my friends.</p>
          <p>I'm currently enrolled in Northwestern Univerity's Coding Bootcamp to pursue my passion in Software Development.This Coding Bootcamp is actually where I learned to make this simple webpage all sexy instead of your typical boring webpages from the 90s that don't have any styling or color.</p>
